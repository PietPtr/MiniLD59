THE CITIZENS OF $NAME ARE MOSTLY $ADJ $PEOPLE. FOR CENTURIES THESE CREATURES NEVER SAW THE $NOUN.
AFTER A 10 YEAR LONG WAR BETWEEN THE $PEOPLE AND $PEOPLE OF $NAME, THEY FINALLY FOUND PEACE. THERE ARE STILL SOME TENSIONS, BUT NOW THAT THE $TRAIT ARE $ADJ AGAIN, THIS WAR WILL MOST LIKELY NOT REPEAT ITSELF.
THE PEOPLE ON $NAME ARE EXTREMELY $ADJ. STEER CLEAR IF POSSIBLE.
ON $NAME THEY HAVE THE BEST $NOUN IN THE WHOLE WIDE GALAXY, THAT'S WHAT THEY CLAIM AT LEAST, OUR REVIEWERS WEREN'T SO SURE.
