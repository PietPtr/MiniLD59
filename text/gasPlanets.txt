THE CITIZENS OF $NAME ARE MOSTLY $ADJ $PEOPLE. FOR CENTURIES THESE CREATURES NEVER HAD $NOUN.
AFTER A 10 YEAR LONG WAR BETWEEN THE $PEOPLE AND $PEOPLE OF $NAME, THEY FINALLY FOUND PEACE. THERE ARE STILL SOME TENSIONS, BUT NOW THAT THE $TRAIT ARE $ADJ AGAIN, THIS WAR WILL MOST LIKELY NOT REPEAT ITSELF.
THE PEOPLE ON $NAME ARE EXTREMELY $ADJ. STEER CLEAR IF POSSIBLE.
ON $NAME THEY HAVE THE BEST $NOUN IN THE WHOLE WIDE GALAXY, THAT'S WHAT THEY CLAIM AT LEAST, OUR REVIEWERS WEREN'T SO SURE.
THE HOSTILE $TRAIT OF $NAME LEAVE NO DOUBT THAT THIS IS A PLANET THAT PREFERS TO STAY UNHABITATED.
THE $PEOPLE ONCE TRIED TO MAKE $NAME INTO A SPA, THIS PLAN WAS GIVEN UP ON AFTER SEVERAL DEATHS IN THE $TRAIT AND THE PLANET WAS ABANDONED.
IT'S JUST SOME $ADJ GAS. WE DON'T RECOMMEND LANDING HERE.
THE $TRAIT ON $NAME ARE $ADJ, AND THE $PEOPLE ARE $ADJ. 
NO TOWELS FOR SALE, WOULD NOT RECOMMEND $NAME. 
AFTER A SHIFT IN THE MAGNETIC FIELD OF $NAME A FEW THOUSAND YEARS AGO, THE PLANET UNDERWENT A HUGE CHANGE: ITS FAMOUS $ADJ $TRAIT DISAPPEARED AND SUDDENLY $TRAIT STARTED APPEARING. $PEOPLE ARE STILL DISCUSSING THE CAUSE OF THE SUDDEN CHANGES.
THE GEOLOGICAL HISTORY OF $NAME IS FASCINATING, BECAUSE THIS GAS PLANET SEEMS TO HAVE APPEARED OUT OF THIN AIR.
