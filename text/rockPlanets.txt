THERE HAS NEVER BEEN LIFE ON $NAME, EVEN THOUGH IT HAS $ADJ $TRAIT. SOME $PEOPLE BELIEVE $NAME COULD BECOME A $ADJ PLANET IF IT HAD MORE $NOUN.
MOSTLY HARMLESS.
THE FIRST FEW MILLIONS OF YEARS OF ITS EXISTENCE THIS PLANET WAS POPULATED WITH $TRAIT AND A LOT OF $ADJ $PEOPLE USED TO LIVE HERE. NOW, MORE THAN 4 BILLION YEARS LATER, ONLY $ADJ $TRAIT REMAIN, AND THE CITIZENS HAVE LEFT.
THROUGH A MIRACULOUS TURN OF EVOLUTION THE $PEOPLE ON $NAME ARE ONLY ABLE TO SAY THESE WORDS: $ADJ $NOUN $TRAIT.
BECAUSE OF AN AGE-OLD BLOODFEUD, THE PEOPLE OF $NAME DON'T TAKE TOO KINDLY TO $NOUN. DON'T RISK GOING HERE UNLESS YOU'RE VERY $ADJ.
THE CIVILIZATION OF $NAME IS LONG GONE, WARS BETWEEN DIFFERENT GROUPS AND TOO EAGER USE OF THE PLANET DESTROYED THE $TRAIT, WITHOUT WHICH LIFE WAS NO LONGER FEASABLE.
IF ONLY THE $ADJ $TRAIT WOULD STILL EXIST ON $NAME, MAYBE THEN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WORTH YOUR TIME. $NAME IS ONLY INHABITED BY $ADJ $PEOPLE WHO LIKE TO COLLECT $NOUN IN THE SUMMER. PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME HERE.
AFTER THE $PEOPLE WON THE GENERAL ELECTION LAST YEAR, THE CURRENCY OF $NAME WAS CHANGED TO $NOUN OR $NOUN, WHATEVER YOU HAVE THE LEAST OF. THESE NEW LAWS ARE TERRIBLY CONFUSING AND MOST OF THE $PEOPLE LEFT TO FIND ANOTHER PLANET. THE $TRAIT ARE TERRIBLE ANYWAY.
$NAME IS FILLED WITH MANY, MANY CIVILISATIONS, EVEN THOUGH IT IS A RELATIVELY SMALL PLANET. THESE CIVILISATIONS FAIL TO PEACEFULLY COEXIST, THOUGH. FOR EXAMPLE: THE $ADJ $PEOPLE, WHO LIVE NEAR THE $ADJ $TRAIT, DON'T WANT THE $PEOPLE NEAR THEIR HOME BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID THEY MIGHT SCRATCH THEM.
