THERE HAS NEVER BEEN LIFE ON $NAME, EVEN THOUGH IT HAS $ADJ $TRAIT. SOME $PEOPLE BELIEVE $NAME COULD BECOME A $ADJ PLANET IF IT HAD MORE $NOUN.
MOSTLY HARMLESS.
THROUGH A MIRACULOUS TURN OF EVOLUTION THE $PEOPLE ON $NAME ARE ONLY ABLE TO SAY THESE THREE WORDS: $ADJ $NOUN $TRAIT.
BECAUSE OF AN AGE-OLD BLOODFEUD, THE PEOPLE OF $NAME DON'T TAKE TO KINDLY TO $NOUN. DON'T RISK GOING HERE UNLESS YOU'RE VERY $TRAIT.
